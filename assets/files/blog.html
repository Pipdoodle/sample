		<h1>We Become What We Behold by Nicky Cage</h1>
	<p> 
We Become What We Behold is a short game by a developer called Nicky Cage for the PC. It's found for free on the web here: https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb, and explores the media and the cycles it tends to perpetrate. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a simple game in which the player's cursor is replaced by a rectangle representing the lens of a camera, or the screen of a TV. The player then clicks to take a picture and then the relating story is translated onto the TV screen in the center of the screen. This is watched by a few people and the experience continues. 
</p>
<p>
This might not seem to like a traditional educational game in that it is not teaching any specific school subject, but it does explore important societal issues. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to playing the game, for the player to understand the message and lesson, the player needs to know about the media, news stations, etc. Hopefully they should have some experience with it, as in they've watched TV or read news articles online, otherwise the lesson could pass over the player's head since they might not make the connection. 
From playing the game however, the player will experience a little bit about what it means to be a journalist as in possible motivations for capturing certain stories over others, how people respond to those kinds of stories, and how what is shown on the news can cause a very large ripple effect outwards. 
</p>
<p>
This can then be applied in how people act. This type of behavior happens not only with news on the TV, but also with any kind of information of gossip. The small effect of a small comment can expand to a giant overblown thing, like the concept of making a mountain out of an anthill. This wouldn't necessarily be directly applied, but rather, by playing the game and being aware of the consequence of actions, it could lead to the audience being more inclined to break the cycle. Instead of believing in whatever gossip they hear and then telling it to more people, they could choose just not to listen to it. Moreover, instead of taking videos and constantly talking about all the negative things happening, it could lead to trying to focus more on the positive stories that exist. 
</p>
<p>
There is only one mechanic in the entire game: clicking to take a picture. This puts the player in the position of the journalist, making it both simple and effective. 
The dynamic of this game is that players make choices of what to take pictures of, resulting in certain stories being told and spread. The only stories then that could progress the game though were stories that resulted in conflict resulting in rising tensions between characters.

This uses the aesthetic of a narrative by having the player go through a story. With a small amount of words, it tells a dramatic narrative story primarily through the mechanic and animation of the characters. The story draws you in because while you seem to define the story, in reality the story is defined by what people are interested in making what seems could be an innocent story bound to be an inevitable tragedy.

<p>
This uses the learning principle of immediate feedback to teach what kind of information is appreciated and gathers attention. For instance, when a picture is taken of protesters, crickets respond, but when a picture is taken of fighting, people gather to watch and then change as a result from seeing it. It also uses examples to show how word spreads in the first place. Nothing happens until the player first takes a picture of hat guy who is clearly distinct from everyone else. By taking the picture of hat guy, other people saw it and then followed the same fad. It shows how new and interesting things attract people’s attention and how people tend to believe the news rather than question it resulting in the spread of that idea. The last learning principle it uses is multimedia. It combines visuals and words to get the message across. For every picture, it accompanies it with a #message that demonstrates what is interesting to people and what isn’t. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, all three aspects combine together very well to send a clear and lasting message. By putting the player in the shoes of a photographer, showing who watches, and the effects afterwards, it shows the players the psychology of the media journalist’s spreading the media as well as putting the responsibility on the player. With the player forced to do the action, and therefore made to bear the guilt of the following events, the game is effective in carrying out its goals. It’s goal gave it the focus to showcase and teach an important concept rather than losing its purpose, the MDA made the game into an experience that is unforgettable, and the learning principles ensured that the lessons are learnt and processed.
