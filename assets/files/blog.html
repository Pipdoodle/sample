<h1>Do I Have a Right? </h1>
<p>
Today I will be critiquing the game “Do I Have a Right” from ICivics. This game is a web game made for the PC and can be found on this link: https://www.icivics.org/games/do-i-have-right. This game teaches users what the amendments of the Constitution are and when they can be applied.

</p>
<p>
In this game, players are introduced to a law firm which they are apparently in charge of. It’s a new law firm with a special opening week to prove it’s worth and ability to everyone. As a result, players are tasked with talking to customers, asking their main issue, and then redirecting them to what lawyer would be best suited for their case. Each lawyer specializes in an amendment of the bill of rights resulting in players having to match cases to their corresponding amendment. Moreover, players must manage their firm by getting customers to their lawyers in a reasonable amount of time as well as placing ads, updating furniture, hiring more lawyers, etc. All in all, it is a charming experiences that makes the normally tedious task of memorizing amendments entertaining as well as encouraging players to really understand what the amendments mean in terms of everyday people and life. 

</p>
<h3> Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
Prior to playing this game, in terms of skills players must be able to read and understand text to at least a middle school level. They need basic problem solving and reading comprehension skills to be able to put together situations and corresponding actions. Next, in terms of knowledge, players should have a basic concept of the judicial system. Players should know that some things are allowed and some things are not, and there are laws both saying some things are or are not allowed. One important piece that players should know is that there is a bill of rights or main amendments to the constitution that define the judicial system as well as other laws in what behaviors are protected and what people have a right to. They should also understand lawyers exist and use these amendments to argue people’s cases and defend them in court. 

</p>
<p>
While playing the game, players can choose to learn the main amendments of the original bill of rights or all the amendments. Regardless, students will know what amendments there are, how many, and what each amendment entails. They will by the end be able to take a situation and know which amendment could be used to defend that situation. In relation, through that, they will also understand what is and is not protected underneath the amendments. 

</p>
<p>
A few other things that players may or may not pick up on is a few marketing things. While mostly for the sake of gameplay, it is true that people are impatient and it will result in losing customers if the service is not satisfactorily or incredibly slow. Similarly, having upgrades and a nice office increases the wait time people are willing to wait before getting angry and annoyed. Moreover, giving better equipment to lawyers helps increase the chance of better performance which reflects reality in that if you give people better supplies and technology it increases their productivity. One last interesting point is that players need to buy ads to get more customers and the better ads get more customers reflecting the importance of marketing inside companies. All in all, while these parts aren’t meant to be taught and it’s not the main point of the game, players may still learn some of these points.   
</p>
<h3> MDA </h3>
<p>
This game only uses clicking as the only interaction players have. In this game, customers come in, and players must click them to interact with them, choose which lawyer to have them interact with, and choose what amendment, and part of the the amendment, the lawyer can use to defend the customer. By succeeding prestige is earned, which can then after the day ends, be used to buy upgrades around the office as well as more lawyers with other different amendment specialties.
</p>
<p>
The dynamic of this game involves fake time pressure and a little experimentation. While time does freeze when making choices of what lawyer to match people to, there is still the feeling of needing to go fast and make decisions quickly since there are customers waiting. This encourages players to memorize the amendments so they can immediately know who to take a case to instead of having to look everything up. A little experimentation does come into play in matching cases to help really understand what amendments mean since they could get it wrong; however, it not encouraged in that it’s better to get none wrong than some wrong. 

</p>
<p> 
This has a challenge aesthetic in which players are challenged both to get the most amount of points but also in general problem solve to figure out what cases require what defense. This makes people analyze situations and the meaning of the different amendments to gain a deeper understanding of what they mean. Moreover, the challenge of getting the most points challenges players to play it multiple times. Thus, through repetition it even better supports the goals of getting people to learn and memorize amendments. 
</p>
<h3> Learning Principles </h3>
<p>
First, most importantly, the game gives almost immediate feedback on when a wrong choice is made as well as why it’s wrong. For instance, when the players turns away a client, a pop up will appear from the partner saying either you were right or wrong. If you match a case with the wrong amendment, then once the lawyer goes on trial, and the trial ends, a pop up will appear saying you lost the case. It will say what the issue was, what amendment was focused on and which part of it, as well as what part should have been used to defend the case. In this way, it gives players a clearer idea of what situations falls under which parts of the amendments. 
 </p>
 <p>
 	Second, information is readily available all around. While looking at situations, it pauses the timer and allows players to both review all the amendments overall and the different parts, as well as what lawyers you own and what they protect. This way, players are constantly reading what the amendments are and slowly getting it into their brain. 

 </p>
 <p>
 	Third, there is scaffolding partially controlled by the player, partially controlled by the game. In the beginning, players cannot solve all cases in that they start with one lawyer who specializes in one amendment. Then over time the game opens up and lawyers learn new amendment pieces as well as users can buy new lawyers. Moreover, the game also puts in customers that want different amendments slowly throughout the game. It starts with primarily customers that just want whichever lawyer you start with, and then adds in slowly throughout the days customers regarding different situations which then require you to at least read the other amendments and figure out that it’s a lawyer and amendment you have not used yet. 
 </p>
 <h3> Synthesis </h3>
 <p>

Overall, everything comes together to create an engaging experience that encourages players to keep playing it through and therefore learn the material. By having a point system and a sense of challenge from the game, it encourages the user to want to replay the game to get the highest possible score. This promotes the learning goal of memorizing the amendments since through doing it enough eventually students are bound to memorize what amendments involve what. Moreover, the fake time pressure encourages players even more to memorize rather than have to open and search up what amendments are at every point in the game. Moreover, the scaffold makes it so that it never is too hard, but never becomes easy or boring either. New information is added only after players have a pretty good idea of the old information and have mostly absorbed it. So then, knowledge is cemented by more cases acting as practice along  a few new cases encouraging players to start learning the next concept. Plus, the new information and new lawyers keeps things interesting rather than repetitive. By having the environment of a lawyer office, i.e the visual aesthetic compounds the idea that these amendments are used to defend people in court and are related to the judicial system. The cartoony style though keeps it feeling like a fun game instead of just reality. All in all, the learning principles acts as the challenge within the MDA, which coupled with points and time pressure encourages players to keep going and potentially replay the game multiple times. Thus, through repetition along with having players have to analyze situations themselves, memorization and understanding can occur thus ensuring the original learning goals.

<h1>Human Resource Machine </h1>
<p>
The next game I will be reviewing is a clearly educational one: Human Resource Machine. Human Resource Machine was created by a studio named Tomorrow Company and is available on Steam for mac and windows. This is a game about teaching programming logic.
</p>
<p>
This game plays as a puzzle game in which there are many levels. These levels are split 
up into sections with a cutscene in between each section. The sections also had varying branching points to allow players to choose to complete more challenging levels or just follow the essential path. Each level also included challenges of how to complete the level further adding difficulty if the player were to choose the want it. The puzzles were all centered around thinking in terms of coding logic. The mechanics were simple with there just being drag and drop and pressing play to run the code. Regardless, it works as a relatively charming game that encourages players to think in an algorithmic way that is then applicable to coding. 
</p>
<p>
Beforehand players should understand how to add, how to subtract, how to read, and other basic mathematical concepts. By playing this game, it shows how simple commands can be changed together to have a larger end result. Moreover, it shows how basic mathematical concepts can be used to construct larger ones i.e addition to make multiplication in a programming and algorithmic environment. Overall, what it does it teaches players about programming logic. This does not actually teach people how to code, but it could then be used to easily code in Scratch which also has the drag and drop environment. Moreover, it can then be applied to constructing algorithms and pseudocode since it explores the logic rather than any syntax. 
</p>
<p>
The mechanics of this game are relatively simple. There are a set of commands which players drag and then drop into a box. They can reorder and take as many of the commands as they want. Once they think the commands will properly order the worker to perform the instructors they press play. The player can also pause at any point in the middle, restart, and stop.
</p>
<p>
The dynamic of the game is experimentation because players are given basically puzzle pieces, and they are given the choice of how to put the pieces together. While there is some guidance, there is not a whole lot, thus allowing players to figure out how things work on their own.
</p>
<p>
The aesthetic  of this game is a challenge puzzle game. It is segmented into different levels that the player must complete that builds upon knowledge and logic gained through previous levels. But just the basic dynamic being challenging it’s also given by suggesting that it can be done in less commands or less comparisons, thus giving players the ability to go back and try and fix those issues to get all the stars. It also has a little bit of narrative story to encourage players to keep going, however the primary aesthetic is still challenge.
</p>
<p>
This game uses several learning principles including segmenting, feedback, and variability. First, it uses scaffolding by not throwing all concepts and commands at the player at once. It starts relatively simply with just showing how instructions can cause the person to move something from the input to the output. Afterwards, concepts like loops are added through commands like jump. Then, logic if/ thens were added and puzzles got harder by experimenting with different ways these things could be combined. Addition and mathematical concepts were then used and concepts such as time and space efficiency were added as challenges which players could then go back and replay levels to incorporate these concepts. Overall, it very slowly introduces new important logical concepts through each level and builds. Next, it gives feedback relatively quickly. It admittedly does not immediately tell the user when a wrong command is put in, but that’s primarily because there are multiple ways to solve a problem. Instead, when running the program, once a wrong behavior happens, it stops and points at that command inside the code. As a result, it gives a general indication of where everything went wrong, thus giving learners a starting point of where to start fixing their logic and code. Finally, variability was used by having students solve various different problems instead of just one. By solving various different problems it helps the students greater understand the logic and generalize the logic so that it can be done outside of the game. Every single level served as a different problem, thus providing variability.
</p>
<p> 
The three pieces all come together to make a good educational game. Since the goal is to teach people programming logic, the MDA of challenge and exploration makes sense because it allows people to understand where the logic comes from. Since logic is a sort of analytic thing and way of thinking, by allowing people to develop it through their own trial and error and process, then they can better understand it rather than just recite facts. Moreover, since programming logic has to be applied to all sorts of different problems, telling people things actually would probably be detrimental since it would prevent it from being transferable. In the way the game is formatted, players have to go through their own process and think through how to solve problems which reflects the reality of how people need to program and code as well. The educational principles also further support the game by making sure it doesn’t become too complicated. The segmenting balances the difficulty thus helping learning happen but also making sure it still remains a fun challenge instead of too much of a challenge. The feedback also helps by making people realize the flows in their logic sooner and being able to pinpoint it easier.  Variability also helps the difficulty by having people still work on the same concept just in a different level/ problem. In this way, players would have a brief reprieve from difficulty thus helping it all come together to create an enjoyable experience where people figure out how programming logic works.

<h1>Detention by Red Candle Studio </h1>
<img src = "artwork/gameScreenshot/detentionTitle.png" >
<p>
The first time I watched Detention was spring of Junior Year high school. Watching it as a livestream, I didn’t really think that much of it at first. It was just a point and click game horror game. I was curious but I didn’t think much else of it. I just expected another one of the jumpscare horror tropes albeit with much better art than normal. </p>
<p>
By the end of the two hours, I was enraptured. By the end of 4, my heart was broken and silent tears were streaming down my face.
</p>
<p>
In four hours it had brought me through a train ride that even now I still remember parts vividly. The story, art, music, all of it was composed together masterfully to tug at the emotions and create an experience. However, none of that was the real reason why it stuck with me even today.  There are many games with riveting and emotional stories: games like Undertale, the Beginner’s Guide, and To the Moon. While they all stayed in my heart, none affected me as much as Detention because they all lacked something which made Detention something so much more: reality. 
</p>
<p>
While the details and supernatural elements obviously were not reality, the world of the storyline was our world a little over 30 years ago: Taiwan: 1949-1987: The White Terror. It was the history; the reality that this was the atmosphere, the fears, the struggles that real people went through that transformed Detention from a good game, to something raw, terrifying and unforgettable. 
</p>
<p>
	It was the educational part of this game that was integral in the inspiration, the purpose, and the meaning of this game and that’s why it’s fascinating to critique this game not through the lense of a normal game, but rather an educational one. 
</p>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
	Detention was created by a studio called Red Candle Studio based in Taiwan. According to Red Candle Studio’s website, they had created Detention because they wanted to raise awareness and share Taiwanese culture. Overall, the experience lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours and can be found on steam for Windows, Mac and Linux.
</p>
<p>
The gameplay of this game is simple. You click wherever you want to go, click whatever you want to examine, and click whatever you want to pick up. Then with an inventory you can drag items to combine them and use them. Occasionally,  there are creatures in which you must hold your breath to get past them, so you right click to hold your breath. You also get a journal with clues to puzzles as well as entries which help tell the overline narrative. 
</p>
<p>
The goal of the game is relatively simple: figure out who the characters are and their stories. All the player needs to do is get through the linear narrative to arrive at one of two endings; however, as the player progresses they quickly discover that have to solve a series of puzzles as well as figure out the true events of the main character’s life with failure meaning being trapped in an endless purgatory forever. 
With just a mouse, Detention creates an experience that tells the very familiar narrative of a girl from a troubled home, a forbidden love, and misunderstandings. Normally, this story would resolve with the drama of crying, broken hearts, maybe some petty revenge scheme, but ultimately things resolve and everyone moves on. However, in Detention, contrary to normal, it’s the educational elements that completely transforms the narrative and experience into an unforgettable moving one. And it’s Detention that turns the tragedy of a time period from a distant story and number to reality.
</p>
<h3>
Educational Objectives
</h3>
<p>
	Defining the educational objectives of Detention is an extremely difficult task due to how complicated and layered it is. While the educational value and intent is undeniable, it’s also extremely variable dependent on the player. Moreover, by the description of the intent of the creators, they did not have a set amount that they wanted the audience to come out with. Rather instead, they wanted the players to have increased awareness of Taiwanese culture and important Taiwanese events. As a result, there is no clear boundaries of what should be known prior and what will be known after; however, I will attempt to describe some regardless.
</p>
<p>
	From a literal skills standpoint, people need to know how to use a mouse and click, as well as how to read english or chinese. Without these skills, the player will either be unable to play the game or unable to get anything out of the game. On the next level, players need to be able to retain information such as the map of the school in their mind, as well be able to problem solve and put different clues together. Much of this game is literally putting different pieces in different locations to unlock something else in the beginning game, and in the end game, it is all about putting together the story of what really happened based on the clues in the text. Technically no map retention is needed; however, since there is no map given, it would be a lot harder if the player is unable to remember what is where and when. So overall, given these basic skills, any player would be able to learn something from this game.  
</p>
<p>
	From here out, depending on the knowledge of the player as well as their attentiveness, players will learn different amount of information. In other words, players need various starting points of understanding to learn different amounts. On the base level, given no knowledge, players will learn about periods of martial law, specifically the White Terror in Taiwan, and the effect it has on the citizens living on martial law. Moreover, they will learn about the effects in a more personal manner. Instead of learning numbers, they follow a specific story resulting in a more empathetic understanding. Note however that the specific story is not a true one, rather a showcase of the kinds of things people endured. Beyond just martial law however, Detention is saturated in pieces of Taiwanese culture as well as important religious pieces. The intention of the game is definitely hoping that players will pick up on the fact that the environment reflects reality in its design, and reflects religious beliefs in it’s supernatural elements; however, it is possible players will simply regard these pieces as atmospheric builders for the sake of gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
	Expanding out from not knowing anything however, the more people already know, the more they will learn because of the fact that it depicts the environment both visually and in story. Even if people already have read from textbooks about this time period, playing the game cements the event as something more concrete and visualizable. Moreover, the game is filled with small easter eggs that will be recognized by those who know more about the White Terror and  Taiwanese culture. In the decorations and in the way the story is told, all of it in some way refers to real pieces of culture that if players already know about the culture to some degree, they would recognize; however, people who don’t know any of it, might not recognize. In conclusion, regardless of previous knowledge, it still is a worthy game to play which anyone can find value from.
</p>
<p>
	It may be difficult to say how the knowledge here can be applied outwards since it is about a specific culture and about a specific event; however, in reality, history repeats, and in this way the empathy gained can be applied to many situations. By learning and understanding the struggles and tragedy of martial law in Taiwan, it also applies to other instances of martial law throughout history. Moreover, by gaining understanding of the culture, it may help people if they interact with those of the older Taiwanese generation. It helps people better respect others, their beliefs, and the trials they underwent. 
</p>

<h3>MDA </h3>
<h3>Mechanic</h3>
<p>
The mechanics of this game are simply as mentioned before, point and click. The right and left click, and moving the mouse are literally the only controls. This expands out to allowing people to click to move places, click to examine things in the environment, click to collect objects, drag to use objects, click to go through the journal, and finally right click to hold your breath. Since there is not much to learn about in terms of controls, it allows the player to focus instead on the puzzles and atmosphere of the game.
</p>
<h3>Dynamic</h3>
<p>
This game unfolded as a relatively slow-paced puzzle game that is extremely linear. Since the speed of movement was restricted to the speed of the character walking to the place you clicked and since the text was not skippable, it ensured that people really tried to absorb what was happening in the game. Instead of learning mechanics, the focus was simply on solving relatively simple puzzles while also taking in the environment and atmosphere. Moreover, there were two mostly distinct sections in which the earlier section focused more on the horror using atmospheric and supernatural elements. This part also involved more finding items and then using them to unlock areas and proceed through the story. In the second part, or more realistically the last 1/4 of the game, the horror shifts to a more subtle yet just as powerful story as the gameplay just turned into answering questions. However, to answer the question correctly, it requires the player to understand the story and acknowledge what they had done, changing the horror from the supernatural to reality. 
</p>
<h3>Aesthetic </h3>
<p>
	This game without a doubt uses a narrative-horror aesthetic. While the puzzles help the player get through the game, they are not super mind blowing and interesting. In reality, it’s the storyline that makes people want to figure out the story and figure out what happened. Moreover, the usage of a narrative-horror aesthetic is essential to the learning principles given that it is attempting to teach history. Since history is just pieces of the past, generally people do not care that much; however, by using a narrative aesthetic, it makes history into something interesting. On top of that, the horror aesthetic promotes even further intrigue to help ensure the player goes through to the end to discover the full story. 
</p>
<h3>
Learning Principles
</h3>
<p>
	Detention does not directly teach any facts; however, instead immersives the player in a world reflecting reality, thus resulting in learning simply by giving the new player an experience. As a result, the learning principles in this game are hard to discern and pick apart; however a few principles that one could consider being used is spatial contiguity and multimedia, cognitive flexibility, and interest and stories.
</p>
<p>
	First and foremost, simply by the structure of the game being a story-based game, it inevitably is based around a story. This makes the topic of history and martial law more interesting since it’s no longer an objective telling of the results of the time period, but rather it shows how it affects people. In other words, instead of saying people were imprisoned, Detention shows how innocent people who just wanted to learn more were imprisoned and others killed due to the jealousy of one girl. It shows how innocent many of these people really were, the futility of their situation, and really helps increase the empathy for those who had to endure that hardship. 
</p>
	<p>
Next, it uses a combination of multimedia and spatial contiguity to help demonstrate the environment. Objects are accompanied with descriptions of the object next to them which shows the meaning and at times the cultural importance of them. Both words and images together are used; however, at times spatial contiguity is not used. Most of the time when objects were gained such as the dice, the description matched reflecting what you see. In one prominent instance though, the image and description differed to make the point hit home. The instance was with the book list. While a picture was on the table, when it was clicked on the be collected and zoomed in, the image was replaced with that of a gun. Even while the description remained seemingly innocuous: the description of a booklist; the image next to it was that of a gun. As a result, by playing with the spatial contiguity and choosing moments to not use it, it created powerful moments that gave players a deeper understanding of the consequences that the time period transforming normally innocent objects. 
<img src = "artwork/gameScreenshot/plane.jpg">
<img src = "artwork/gameScreenshot/DetentionGun.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Finally, it uses a little bit of cognitive flexibility to show the different perspectives and effects of the action. There’s is not a whole lot of it, since it does not show the point of view of the government or administration, but it does show both the girl and the boy’s point of view and the effect it had on them both. With the boy, we saw the effect of imprisonment and surviving resulting in a ruined man even after being pardoned. With the girl, we saw the effect of the guilt of realizing the consequences of her telling the officer about the book club reading banned material. We also saw the reasoning which emphasized that she was not a villain but rather a normal teenager. We saw how her home life was troubled and all she wanted was to be loved by another. We also saw how she saw her mother tell on her father and it improve her home situation; and therefore it made sense for her to believe telling would help solve her problems. Ultimately, it ended with her in purgatory after committing suicide, bound to repeat over and over her sins. Together, using both perspectives, it helps the player truly understand that the events were a tragedy and even people who did things like report others were not villains but rather normal people who made mistakes in the wrong time period. 
</p>
<h3>
Synthesis
</h3>
<p>
	In summation, Detention is an extremely compelling game with it’s story, music, and art all coming together to create a masterpiece. It uses the EDGE framework masterfully in that with their educational goal of teaching culture, the MDA and learning principles were chosen carefully to match. Since it wanted to teach culture and history as well as have people care about it, the learning principles were less about teaching any one specific fact and making sure they retain it; rather it was more about generating empathy. The use of story, cognitive flexibility, and spatial contiguity or lack of spatial contiguity together created a more emotional experience which therefore had a greater chance of resulting in empathy from the player. With that empathy would ideally come memory as well as curiosity to find out more, or perhaps even replay resulting in an even deeper understanding of the event. Moreover, the cognitive flexibility helped give a fuller understanding of the time period thus melding the learning principles with the educational objective perfectly. From there, the MDA was made to match by having simple mechanics based more around exploration and the story rather than any flashy controls. The aesthetic also matched perfectly in that it focused on narrative, but also in that it was horror. Horror was more than just making it interesting; it also matched the reality. The White Terror was not a period of fun and games or laughs and giggles; rather it was an oppressive time filled with wrongful imprisonments and deaths. By using horror, it further cemented the time period and how it felt to those living in it. One last important piece was the choice to not have the player know what was happening. By orienting the entire game around finding out what happened, it not only reflected the literal events of what happens in Taiwanese culture in purgatory, but it also put the player in the shoes of the main character. All in all, all three pieces came together perfectly to make an extremely good example of a historical educational video game.

		<h1>We Become What We Behold by Nicky Case</h1>
	<p> 
We Become What We Behold is a short game by a developer called Nicky Case for the PC. It's found for free on the web here: https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb, and explores the media and the cycles it tends to perpetrate. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a simple game in which the player's cursor is replaced by a rectangle representing the lens of a camera, or the screen of a TV. The player then clicks to take a picture and then the relating story is translated onto the TV screen in the center of the screen. This is watched by a few people, changing the behavior of those few people, and the experience continues. 
</p>
<p>
This might not seem to like a traditional educational game in that it is not teaching any specific school subject, but it does explore important societal issues. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to playing the game, for the player to understand the message and lesson, the player needs to know about the media, news stations, etc. Hopefully they should have some experience with it, as in they've watched TV or read news articles online, otherwise the lesson could pass over the player's head since they might not make the connection. 
From playing the game however, the player will experience a little bit about what it means to be a journalist as in possible motivations for capturing certain stories over others, how people respond to those kinds of stories, and how what is shown on the news can cause a very large ripple effect outwards. 
</p>
<p>
This can then be applied in how people act. This type of behavior happens not only with news on the TV, but also with any kind of information of gossip. The small effect of a small comment can expand to a giant overblown thing, like the concept of making a mountain out of an anthill. This wouldn't necessarily be directly applied, but rather, by playing the game and being aware of the consequence of actions, it could lead to the audience being more inclined to break the cycle. Instead of believing in whatever gossip they hear and then telling it to more people, they could choose just not to listen to it. Moreover, instead of taking videos and constantly talking about all the negative things happening, it could lead to trying to focus more on the positive stories that exist.  
</p>
<p>
There is only one mechanic in the entire game: clicking to take a picture. This puts the player in the position of the journalist, making it both simple and effective. 
The dynamic of this game is that players make choices of what to take pictures of, resulting in certain stories being told and spread. The only stories then that could progress the game though were stories that resulted in conflict resulting in rising tensions between characters.
</p>
<img src = "artwork/BeholdCapture1.png"  style: "width: 100px; height: 100px" />
<p>
This uses the aesthetic of a narrative by having the player go through a story. With a small amount of words, it tells a dramatic narrative story primarily through the mechanic and animation of the characters. The story draws you in because while you seem to define the story, in reality the story is defined by what people are interested in making what seems could be an innocent story bound to be an inevitable tragedy. 
</p>

<img src = "artwork/BeholdCapture2.png"  style: "width: 100px; height: 100px" />
<p>
This uses the learning principle of immediate feedback to teach what kind of information is appreciated and gathers attention. For instance, when a picture is taken of protesters, crickets respond, but when a picture is taken of fighting, people gather to watch and then change as a result from seeing it. It also uses examples to show how word spreads in the first place. Nothing happens until the player first takes a picture of hat guy who is clearly distinct from everyone else. By taking the picture of hat guy, other people saw it and then followed the same fad. It shows how new and interesting things attract people’s attention and how people tend to believe the news rather than question it resulting in the spread of that idea. The last learning principle it uses is multimedia. It combines visuals and words to get the message across.
