<h1>Detention by Red Candle Studio </h1>
<img src = "artwork/gameScreenshot/detentionTitle.png" >
<p>
The first time I watched Detention was spring of Junior Year high school. Watching it as a livestream, I didn’t really think that much of it at first. It was just a point and click game horror game. I was curious but I didn’t think much else of it. I just expected another one of the jumpscare horror tropes albeit with much better art than normal. </p>
<p>
By the end of the two hours, I was enraptured. By the end of 4, my heart was broken and silent tears were streaming down my face.
</p>
<p>
In four hours it had brought me through a train ride that even now I still remember parts vividly. The story, art, music, all of it was composed together masterfully to tug at the emotions and create an experience. However, none of that was the real reason why it stuck with me even today.  There are many games with riveting and emotional stories: games like Undertale, the Beginner’s Guide, and To the Moon. While they all stayed in my heart, none affected me as much as Detention because they all lacked something which made Detention something so much more: reality. 
</p>
<p>
While the details and supernatural elements obviously were not reality, the world of the storyline was our world a little over 30 years ago: Taiwan: 1949-1987: The White Terror. It was the history; the reality that this was the atmosphere, the fears, the struggles that real people went through that transformed Detention from a good game, to something raw, terrifying and unforgettable. 
</p>
<p>
	It was the educational part of this game that was integral in the inspiration, the purpose, and the meaning of this game and that’s why it’s fascinating to critique this game not through the lense of a normal game, but rather an educational one. 
</p>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
	Detention was created by a studio called Red Candle Studio based in Taiwan. According to Red Candle Studio’s website, they had created Detention because they wanted to raise awareness and share Taiwanese culture. Overall, the experience lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours and can be found on steam for Windows, Mac and Linux.
</p>
<p>
The gameplay of this game is simple. You click wherever you want to go, click whatever you want to examine, and click whatever you want to pick up. Then with an inventory you can drag items to combine them and use them. Occasionally,  there are creatures in which you must hold your breath to get past them, so you right click to hold your breath. You also get a journal with clues to puzzles as well as entries which help tell the overline narrative. 
</p>
<p>
The goal of the game is relatively simple: figure out who the characters are and their stories. All the player needs to do is get through the linear narrative to arrive at one of two endings; however, as the player progresses they quickly discover that have to solve a series of puzzles as well as figure out the true events of the main character’s life with failure meaning being trapped in an endless purgatory forever. 
With just a mouse, Detention creates an experience that tells the very familiar narrative of a girl from a troubled home, a forbidden love, and misunderstandings. Normally, this story would resolve with the drama of crying, broken hearts, maybe some petty revenge scheme, but ultimately things resolve and everyone moves on. However, in Detention, contrary to normal, it’s the educational elements that completely transforms the narrative and experience into an unforgettable moving one. And it’s Detention that turns the tragedy of a time period from a distant story and number to reality.
</p>
<h3>
Educational Objectives
</h3>
<p>
	Defining the educational objectives of Detention is an extremely difficult task due to how complicated and layered it is. While the educational value and intent is undeniable, it’s also extremely variable dependent on the player. Moreover, by the description of the intent of the creators, they did not have a set amount that they wanted the audience to come out with. Rather instead, they wanted the players to have increased awareness of Taiwanese culture and important Taiwanese events. As a result, there is no clear boundaries of what should be known prior and what will be known after; however, I will attempt to describe some regardless.
</p>
<p>
	From a literal skills standpoint, people need to know how to use a mouse and click, as well as how to read english or chinese. Without these skills, the player will either be unable to play the game or unable to get anything out of the game. On the next level, players need to be able to retain information such as the map of the school in their mind, as well be able to problem solve and put different clues together. Much of this game is literally putting different pieces in different locations to unlock something else in the beginning game, and in the end game, it is all about putting together the story of what really happened based on the clues in the text. Technically no map retention is needed; however, since there is no map given, it would be a lot harder if the player is unable to remember what is where and when. So overall, given these basic skills, any player would be able to learn something from this game.  
</p>
<p>
	From here out, depending on the knowledge of the player as well as their attentiveness, players will learn different amount of information. In other words, players need various starting points of understanding to learn different amounts. On the base level, given no knowledge, players will learn about periods of martial law, specifically the White Terror in Taiwan, and the effect it has on the citizens living on martial law. Moreover, they will learn about the effects in a more personal manner. Instead of learning numbers, they follow a specific story resulting in a more empathetic understanding. Note however that the specific story is not a true one, rather a showcase of the kinds of things people endured. Beyond just martial law however, Detention is saturated in pieces of Taiwanese culture as well as important religious pieces. The intention of the game is definitely hoping that players will pick up on the fact that the environment reflects reality in its design, and reflects religious beliefs in it’s supernatural elements; however, it is possible players will simply regard these pieces as atmospheric builders for the sake of gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
	Expanding out from not knowing anything however, the more people already know, the more they will learn because of the fact that it depicts the environment both visually and in story. Even if people already have read from textbooks about this time period, playing the game cements the event as something more concrete and visualizable. Moreover, the game is filled with small easter eggs that will be recognized by those who know more about the White Terror and  Taiwanese culture. In the decorations and in the way the story is told, all of it in some way refers to real pieces of culture that if players already know about the culture to some degree, they would recognize; however, people who don’t know any of it, might not recognize. In conclusion, regardless of previous knowledge, it still is a worthy game to play which anyone can find value from.
</p>
<p>
	It may be difficult to say how the knowledge here can be applied outwards since it is about a specific culture and about a specific event; however, in reality, history repeats, and in this way the empathy gained can be applied to many situations. By learning and understanding the struggles and tragedy of martial law in Taiwan, it also applies to other instances of martial law throughout history. Moreover, by gaining understanding of the culture, it may help people if they interact with those of the older Taiwanese generation. It helps people better respect others, their beliefs, and the trials they underwent. 
</p>

<h3>MDA </h3>
<h3>Mechanic</h3>
<p>
The mechanics of this game are simply as mentioned before, point and click. The right and left click, and moving the mouse are literally the only controls. This expands out to allowing people to click to move places, click to examine things in the environment, click to collect objects, drag to use objects, click to go through the journal, and finally right click to hold your breath. Since there is not much to learn about in terms of controls, it allows the player to focus instead on the puzzles and atmosphere of the game.
</p>
<h3>Dynamic</h3>
<p>
This game unfolded as a relatively slow-paced puzzle game that is extremely linear. Since the speed of movement was restricted to the speed of the character walking to the place you clicked and since the text was not skippable, it ensured that people really tried to absorb what was happening in the game. Instead of learning mechanics, the focus was simply on solving relatively simple puzzles while also taking in the environment and atmosphere. Moreover, there were two mostly distinct sections in which the earlier section focused more on the horror using atmospheric and supernatural elements. This part also involved more finding items and then using them to unlock areas and proceed through the story. In the second part, or more realistically the last 1/4 of the game, the horror shifts to a more subtle yet just as powerful story as the gameplay just turned into answering questions. However, to answer the question correctly, it requires the player to understand the story and acknowledge what they had done, changing the horror from the supernatural to reality. 
</p>
<h3>Aesthetic </h3>
<p>
	This game without a doubt uses a narrative-horror aesthetic. While the puzzles help the player get through the game, they are not super mind blowing and interesting. In reality, it’s the storyline that makes people want to figure out the story and figure out what happened. Moreover, the usage of a narrative-horror aesthetic is essential to the learning principles given that it is attempting to teach history. Since history is just pieces of the past, generally people do not care that much; however, by using a narrative aesthetic, it makes history into something interesting. On top of that, the horror aesthetic promotes even further intrigue to help ensure the player goes through to the end to discover the full story. 
</p>
<h3>
Learning Principles
</h3>
<p>
	Detention does not directly teach any facts; however, instead immersives the player in a world reflecting reality, thus resulting in learning simply by giving the new player an experience. As a result, the learning principles in this game are hard to discern and pick apart; however a few principles that one could consider being used is spatial contiguity and multimedia, cognitive flexibility, and interest and stories.
</p>
<p>
	First and foremost, simply by the structure of the game being a story-based game, it inevitably is based around a story. This makes the topic of history and martial law more interesting since it’s no longer an objective telling of the results of the time period, but rather it shows how it affects people. In other words, instead of saying people were imprisoned, Detention shows how innocent people who just wanted to learn more were imprisoned and others killed due to the jealousy of one girl. It shows how innocent many of these people really were, the futility of their situation, and really helps increase the empathy for those who had to endure that hardship. 
</p>
	<p>
Next, it uses a combination of multimedia and spatial contiguity to help demonstrate the environment. Objects are accompanied with descriptions of the object next to them which shows the meaning and at times the cultural importance of them. Both words and images together are used; however, at times spatial contiguity is not used. Most of the time when objects were gained such as the dice, the description matched reflecting what you see. In one prominent instance though, the image and description differed to make the point hit home. The instance was with the book list. While a picture was on the table, when it was clicked on the be collected and zoomed in, the image was replaced with that of a gun. Even while the description remained seemingly innocuous: the description of a booklist; the image next to it was that of a gun. As a result, by playing with the spatial contiguity and choosing moments to not use it, it created powerful moments that gave players a deeper understanding of the consequences that the time period transforming normally innocent objects.

</p>
<p>
Finally, it uses a little bit of cognitive flexibility to show the different perspectives and effects of the action. There’s is not a whole lot of it, since it does not show the point of view of the government or administration, but it does show both the girl and the boy’s point of view and the effect it had on them both. With the boy, we saw the effect of imprisonment and surviving resulting in a ruined man even after being pardoned. With the girl, we saw the effect of the guilt of realizing the consequences of her telling the officer about the book club reading banned material. We also saw the reasoning which emphasized that she was not a villain but rather a normal teenager. We saw how her home life was troubled and all she wanted was to be loved by another. We also saw how she saw her mother tell on her father and it improve her home situation; and therefore it made sense for her to believe telling would help solve her problems. Ultimately, it ended with her in purgatory after committing suicide, bound to repeat over and over her sins. Together, using both perspectives, it helps the player truly understand that the events were a tragedy and even people who did things like report others were not villains but rather normal people who made mistakes in the wrong time period. 
</p>
<h3>
Synthesis
</h3>
<p>
	In summation, Detention is an extremely compelling game with it’s story, music, and art all coming together to create a masterpiece. It uses the EDGE framework masterfully in that with their educational goal of teaching culture, the MDA and learning principles were chosen carefully to match. Since it wanted to teach culture and history as well as have people care about it, the learning principles were less about teaching any one specific fact and making sure they retain it; rather it was more about generating empathy. The use of story, cognitive flexibility, and spatial contiguity or lack of spatial contiguity together created a more emotional experience which therefore had a greater chance of resulting in empathy from the player. With that empathy would ideally come memory as well as curiosity to find out more, or perhaps even replay resulting in an even deeper understanding of the event. Moreover, the cognitive flexibility helped give a fuller understanding of the time period thus melding the learning principles with the educational objective perfectly. From there, the MDA was made to match by having simple mechanics based more around exploration and the story rather than any flashy controls. The aesthetic also matched perfectly in that it focused on narrative, but also in that it was horror. Horror was more than just making it interesting; it also matched the reality. The White Terror was not a period of fun and games or laughs and giggles; rather it was an oppressive time filled with wrongful imprisonments and deaths. By using horror, it further cemented the time period and how it felt to those living in it. One last important piece was the choice to not have the player know what was happening. By orienting the entire game around finding out what happened, it not only reflected the literal events of what happens in Taiwanese culture in purgatory, but it also put the player in the shoes of the main character. All in all, all three pieces came together perfectly to make an extremely good example of a historical educational video game.

		<h1>We Become What We Behold by Nicky Case</h1>
	<p> 
We Become What We Behold is a short game by a developer called Nicky Case for the PC. It's found for free on the web here: https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb, and explores the media and the cycles it tends to perpetrate. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a simple game in which the player's cursor is replaced by a rectangle representing the lens of a camera, or the screen of a TV. The player then clicks to take a picture and then the relating story is translated onto the TV screen in the center of the screen. This is watched by a few people, changing the behavior of those few people, and the experience continues. 
</p>
<p>
This might not seem to like a traditional educational game in that it is not teaching any specific school subject, but it does explore important societal issues. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to playing the game, for the player to understand the message and lesson, the player needs to know about the media, news stations, etc. Hopefully they should have some experience with it, as in they've watched TV or read news articles online, otherwise the lesson could pass over the player's head since they might not make the connection. 
From playing the game however, the player will experience a little bit about what it means to be a journalist as in possible motivations for capturing certain stories over others, how people respond to those kinds of stories, and how what is shown on the news can cause a very large ripple effect outwards. 
</p>
<p>
This can then be applied in how people act. This type of behavior happens not only with news on the TV, but also with any kind of information of gossip. The small effect of a small comment can expand to a giant overblown thing, like the concept of making a mountain out of an anthill. This wouldn't necessarily be directly applied, but rather, by playing the game and being aware of the consequence of actions, it could lead to the audience being more inclined to break the cycle. Instead of believing in whatever gossip they hear and then telling it to more people, they could choose just not to listen to it. Moreover, instead of taking videos and constantly talking about all the negative things happening, it could lead to trying to focus more on the positive stories that exist.  
</p>
<p>
There is only one mechanic in the entire game: clicking to take a picture. This puts the player in the position of the journalist, making it both simple and effective. 
The dynamic of this game is that players make choices of what to take pictures of, resulting in certain stories being told and spread. The only stories then that could progress the game though were stories that resulted in conflict resulting in rising tensions between characters.
</p>
<img src = "artwork/BeholdCapture1.png"  style: "width: 100px; height: 100px" />
<p>
This uses the aesthetic of a narrative by having the player go through a story. With a small amount of words, it tells a dramatic narrative story primarily through the mechanic and animation of the characters. The story draws you in because while you seem to define the story, in reality the story is defined by what people are interested in making what seems could be an innocent story bound to be an inevitable tragedy. 
</p>

<img src = "artwork/BeholdCapture2.png"  style: "width: 100px; height: 100px" />
<p>
This uses the learning principle of immediate feedback to teach what kind of information is appreciated and gathers attention. For instance, when a picture is taken of protesters, crickets respond, but when a picture is taken of fighting, people gather to watch and then change as a result from seeing it. It also uses examples to show how word spreads in the first place. Nothing happens until the player first takes a picture of hat guy who is clearly distinct from everyone else. By taking the picture of hat guy, other people saw it and then followed the same fad. It shows how new and interesting things attract people’s attention and how people tend to believe the news rather than question it resulting in the spread of that idea. The last learning principle it uses is multimedia. It combines visuals and words to get the message across. For every picture, it accompanies it with a #message that demonstrates what is interesting to people and what isn’t. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, all three aspects combine together very well to send a clear and lasting message. By putting the player in the shoes of a photographer, showing who watches, and the effects afterwards, it shows the players the psychology of the media journalist’s spreading the media as well as putting the responsibility on the player. With the player forced to do the action, and therefore made to bear the guilt of the following events, the game is effective in carrying out its goals. It’s goal gave it the focus to showcase and teach an important concept rather than losing its purpose, the MDA made the game into an experience that is unforgettable, and the learning principles ensured that the lessons are learnt and processed.
