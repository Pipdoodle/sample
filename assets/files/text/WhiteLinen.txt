<p>
In other lands, they laugh and play<br>
In other lands, they study and learn<br>
In other lands, they gossip and talk<br>
In other lands, they have futures<br>
<br>
In other lands, they plan for careers<br>
In other lands, they work for success<br>
In other lands, they hope for love<br>
In other lands, they have dreams<br>
<br>
In our land,<br>
Our bodies are sold;<br>
we lay on a bed,<br>
and pray for the end.<br>
